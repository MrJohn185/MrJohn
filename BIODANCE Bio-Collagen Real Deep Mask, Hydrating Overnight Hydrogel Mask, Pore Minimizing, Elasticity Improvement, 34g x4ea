DEEP HYDRATION: The oligo-hyaluronic acid in the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask provides superior moisturizing effects compared to regular hyaluronic acid. It quickly hydrates the skin's surface and penetrates deeper layers, leaving the complexion healthy and well-moisturized.
PORE TIGHTENING & FIRMING: Ultra-low molecular collagen maximizes absorption and skin penetration. It helps refine enlarged pores, enhances skin elasticity immediately after application, and visibly reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
BRIGHTENS THE SKIN: Formulated with Galactomyces Ferment Filtrate and Niacinamide, it improves uneven skin tone and texture while offering antioxidant effects, resulting in healthier, more radiant skin.
AMPOULE SOLIDIFIED: Each 1.19 oz bottle of ampoule is solidified into a sheet mask.
BECOMES TRANSPARENT: The mask turns transparent after 3 hours or overnight, delivering active ingredients deep into the skin.
SAFE FOR SENSITIVE SKIN: All Biodance products are formulated with non-toxic, non-irritant ingredients. They are free from common allergens and 19 other harmful or controversial substances, making them completely safe for sensitive skin.
